Some people deserve credit for their contributions.

Erik Enge - Has been invaluable in pushing Albert further with good
	    questions, feedback, suggestions, etc.

Eugene Zaikonnikov - Gives feedback and advice, and has allowed me to
		     use his good Etiquette project as guinea pig for
		     Albert.

Kevin Rosenberg - The master of all things lisp+debian is maintaining
		  the debian package of Albert, not a small job with
		  an ever-changing Debian.  Also helped out with good
		  suggestions and feedback for Albert.
