Albert is a Common Lisp doc-generator, comparable to Javadoc and
Doxygen.  Currently it generates DocBook.  It reads an ASDF system
definition and documents the system.  It is an experimental system
which may or may not work for you.  It's just a tool I use, which
others might have an interest in.

See web/index.html for more information and documentation.

NOTE:
You might want/need to tweak the settings in settings.lisp, 
possibly checking the path to xml2sexp. (Ignore xml2esis)
To compile the xml2sexp program, run 'make'.
