	* These changes have happened between last release and today.
	* New albert-setting, ("albert" "lisp2csf" "display-progress") to
	show which files are processed.
	* Fixed embarrassing bug that stopped albert from working on newer
	sbcl versions.
	* Started work on internal ids and ids in generated docbook, must
	preserve more info than just use @ or X
	* Made lisp2csf more failsafe when checking files
	* After testing on Maxima, avoid some bugs from happening when
	working on improper lists.
	* Currently does wrong on macros that needs destructuring, just
	flattens them now.
	* Added actual handling of &rest and &body
	* Made asdf/defsystem more robust and it needs not be available
	when albert is compiled.
	* minor tweaking.
	* tagged tree VER_0_4_10
	
2003-10-27	Stig E Sandø <stig@users.sourceforge.net>
	* New file spres/files.lisp for file-related stuff in
	presentation code.
	* New file tools/docme.lisp to document albert itself.
	* Two new icons exported.png and internal.png added to data/icons/
	and are referred to by data/albert.dsl wrt export-status.
	* Made class-hierarchy setting numeric instead of boolean, see
	settings.lisp
	* Added preliminary support for listing 'related methods' in
	classes and structs.  Related methods are methods that dispatch on
	that particular class or struct. Can be controlled via a setting.
	* Can make a separate page for variables in a package if they're
	many.  Controlled by a setting.
	* Can now control where slot-accessors and readers/writers are
	listed in the data (in the class they refer to or in the package
	itself or even both).
	* Now uses proper parent-info in the sdoc-handling in spres
	* Have improved lisp2csf handling of complex source, and it will
	be less likely to crash and get the accurate info.  Now uses a
	testsuite to ensure that things remain solid and liberal.  Are
	looking for more code to add to testsuite.
	* lisp2csf will now handle defparameter, keyword-parameters and
	optional parameters correctly.  lisp2csf will also understand more
	calls to EXPORT and use that info.  lisp2csf allows you to control
	how to prepare the readtable, e.g sbcl needs several tweaks there.
	* spres will try to put more info in other xml-files than
	book.xml, improving debugging and overview of generated data.
	This is the first step in making albert produce output that allows
	easy inclusion of other docs and easy inclusion of albert api docs in
	other docs.
	* Changes lookup of names to use new parent-info in the
	presentation.  This may cause problems in some cases, but in the
	testsuite it is more correct and flexible than the old lookups.
	* Added back in locations in presentations of methods, also with
	cvsview support.
	* Removed caching and several other faster tricks in code,
	resulting in slower, but more correct code.
	* Many other bugfixes, cleanups, improvements and stuff behind the
	scenes. 
	* Tagged tree VER_0_4_9
	
2003-10-20	Stig E Sandø <stig@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added printout of the class-hierarchy Albert already used
	internally.  This closes a feature request.
	* Added settings to control if index or class-hierarchy should
	be printed in docs.
	* Fixed package-nickname bug which might've screwed up people's
	documentation in nasty ways. 
	* Fixed a few show-stopper bugs for some people, also fixed a few
	slightly embarassing issues.
	* Tagged tree VER_0_4_8
	
2003-10-18	Stig E Sandø <stig@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added preliminary MK-DEFSYSTEM support with albert.system and
	allowing sds-asdf.lisp handle mk-defsystem in certain cases.
	Thanks to Enometh for exploring this option.
	* Added several new configurable albert-settings, see
	web/properties.html and settings.lisp for documentation.
	* Updated clisp's EAT-FILE to work in CRLF environment.
	* Added support for filtering non-exported symbols, also added
	support for using CSS to separate exported from non-exported data.
	* User can now control <title> of HTML-pages in Lisp, see
	web/faq.html
	* Updated gnome-icons to work with IE
	* In Lisp2Csf, added handling of defconstant and did some work on
	defstructs.
	* Added support for inclusion of licence-file in documentation.
	* Can now control TOC entries for classes, gfs, .. either via
	settings or via @purpose in docstrings.
	* Now allows use of Albert without using intermediate files or
	xml-parser.
	* Several other minor bugs and issues fixed.
	* Tagged tree VER_0_4_7
	
2003-08-07	Stig E Sandø <stig@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added hack to let lisp2csf skip dispatch-macro-characters and
	carry on READing.
	* Made EAT-FILE use EXCL:OCTETS-TO-STRING for all allegro
	versions.
	* Fixed crashing bug for calls/calledby gathering in lisp2csf,
	will use more lenient (FORMAT NIL "~A" X) instead of (STRING X)
	now.
	* Minor fixes, tweaking and improved error messages.
	
2003-07-11	Stig E Sandø <stig@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Improved navigation-bars for header and footer in the albert.dsl
	file, and added icons that are used in data/icons/
	* Improved documentation with a separate howto.html and several
	improvements in the other docs.
	* Added a preliminary DSSSL file for printable albert output, e.g
	for generating pdf or postscript files via jadetex.
	* Made quickindex and when to show calls-info configurable via
	settings.
	* Tweaked the albert.css file a lot
	* Tweaked and partly commented the albert.dsl file for HTML output and
	deprecated several parts of the old DSSSL code.  It should be much
	easier to configure the albert.dsl behaviour now.
	* Improved the code in several places, as well as the docbook
	output, but nothing major.
	* Tagged tree VER_0_4_6
	
2003-07-05	Stig E Sandø <stig@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Improved compilation settings and order, and reduced verbosity
	and warnings when compiling.
	* Removed many unused/obsolete files
	* Renamed sdoc.css and sdoc.dsl to albert.css and albert.dsl in
	the data/ directory (I've updated debian/rules for this change too)
	* Tweaked exports from SPRES-IMPL package
	* Added support for linking to viewcvs.cgi scripts when displaying
	filename for e.g classes, structs, ..
	* Will now by default generate output in the directory where the
	ASDF-file was found, if the old behaviour using current directory
	as default is wanted, that can also be set.  See
	web/properties.html Thanks to Erik Enge for reporting this.
	* Can now control verbosity of albert via settings.
	* Kevin Rosenberg has updated debian/ directory to be better fit
	for debian unstable.  He is maintaining that directory.
	* Fixed :CONC-NAME behaviour in defstructs for argument
	NIL. (Thanks to nikodemus on freenode #lisp for testing and
	finding the bug)
	* Fix a bug in hovertext getting bad data, e.g & instead of &amp;
	* Updated documentation and added FAQ.
	* Tagged tree VER_0_4_5
