dribble-on, dribble-off
set-break, remove-break, show-breaks

add documentation to classes, functions, methods, macros and slots (using :documentation in slot definition)
templates.lisp:make-tmpl-object: remove call to exil-env:find-template, this function should
be called with the template object directly (otherwise this introduces a cyclic dependency
