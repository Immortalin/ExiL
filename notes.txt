TODO:
- fix watcher printing - no newlines in LW
  - fresh-line doesn't seem to work
- fix quicklisp/asdf loading in LW - experiment with eval-when around
  (defenv default) (setenv default)

- define all query functions to return external representation
- define all functional counterparts to expect external representation
  - in case of multiple parts, these are splat as params
  - e.g. (find-rule) returns (name conditions activations),
    defrulef takes 3 params - name, conditions, activations, but these
    need to be compatible
- test this compatibility

- test all front-end return values
- test env-copy-p, common-slots-p and ability to continue computation
  after undo/redo with respect to backward inference


FUNCTIONAL INSERTORS SHOULD USE THE SAME EXTERNAL REPRESENTATION:
(find-template :tmpl) should be (deftemplatef)-able (after deconsing)
(find-fact-group :grp) should be (deffactsf)-able (after deconsing)
(find-rule) should be (defrulef)-able (after deconsing)

- examples cause 50% stack depletion in LW, but that's probably not
  a problem I need to solve
