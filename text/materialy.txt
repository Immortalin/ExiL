* Introduction to Expert Systems [Peter Jackson]
  * What are expert systems?
    * nature of knowledge and expertise, aim of ES, typical tasks solved by ES
    * characteristics of ES, differences from other AI
    * knowledge representation - characteristics, criteria, conventions
    * explaining solutions
    * ES applicability
  * Overview of AI
    * what is AI, where does ES fit in
    * evolution of AI, what led towards ES
      * state space search
        * depth-first, breadth-first, generate-and-test
        * theorem proving
        * forward-chaining and combinatorial explosion
        * heuristic search (search direction strategies)
        * applicability
      * knowledge representation schemes
        * production rules
        * protocol analysis
        * associative nets
        * logical formulas
        * computer understanding
      * separation of knowledge base and reasoning apparatus
        * pros and cons
        * trade-off btw. inference engine simplicity and flexibility of knowledge repr.
  * Knowledge representation
    * properties and criteria
      - unambiguous, self-contained, organized, processable and storable by computer
    * definitions - representation, description, syntax, semantics, problem
    * historic implementations
      * STRIPS
        - state, operators (preconditions, delete list, add list), goals
        - very simple fact and rule structure - low flexibility, simple inference
        - means-ends analysis - backward chaining
        - matching, substitution, goal selection, conflict resolution
        - uniform representation, problem reduction, heuristic search
      * MYCIN
        - domain specific
        - uncertainty, rule weighting
        - static and dynamic parts of knowledge base
        - separation of consultation and knowledge acquisition components
        - more flexible rules - disjunctions in conditions, consequences can be instructions
        - more diferentiated knowledge representation
        -> more complex inference
    * ES evaluation
    * limitations of mentioned systems
  * Symbolic computation
    * representation of state as symbolic structures and inference rules as transformation rules
    * physical symbol systems
    * building blocks - symbols, sets, sequences, tuples
    * LISP and its advantages for sym. comp. (and disadvantages)
    * lisp overview
  * Rule-based systems
    * intelligent behavior based on domain-relevant rules
    * syntax of rules, encoding and manipulation of state, conditions, activations
    * production systems - production memory, rule interpreter, working memory
    * object-attribute-value triplets, structured facts (object-attribute-value vectors)
    * variables in rules, bindings, consistency, singleton variable
    * CLIPS
      * program structure
      * inference execution
      * controlling inference - agenda, termination, conflict resolution strategies (nondeterminism)
      * search space
    * forward X backward chaining, solution generations X recognition
    * meta-rules - advanced reasoning control
